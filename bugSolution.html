The solution is to apply the styles directly to the element instead of using the `@apply` directive for pseudo-selectors:

```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
  Hover Me
</button>
```

This ensures that the styles are correctly associated with the hover state.
